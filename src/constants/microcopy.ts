/**
 * Centralized, locale-aware microcopy proxy.
 *
 * Importing `microcopy` from here is the single canonical way to read a
 * user-visible string. Each access (e.g. `microcopy.actions.cancel`) is
 * forwarded through a Proxy to the currently active dictionary that lives
 * in `src/i18n/active.ts`, so the same component code renders the right
 * language without any per-component refactor.
 *
 * The English literal (the structural baseline that every other locale
 * must match) lives in `src/i18n/locales/en.ts` — that file is also the
 * Proxy's default fallback, the `Dictionary` type derivation point, and
 * the seed for `i18n/active.ts`. Keeping the literal there breaks an
 * otherwise-circular import: `microcopy.ts` → `i18n/active.ts` →
 * `i18n/locales/en.ts` (no edges back).
 *
 * The exported `microcopy` symbol is typed as `typeof enSource` so call
 * sites keep their literal autocomplete (`microcopy.actions.editTask`
 * still has a known shape) and existing strict tests keep compiling.
