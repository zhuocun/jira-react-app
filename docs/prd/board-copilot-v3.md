| Status            | Draft v3 — merges and supersedes `board-copilot-v3-ux.md`. v2.1 remains the binding backend/wire contract; v3 is the UX and product layer on top of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## 1. Executive Summary

Board Copilot has shipped five capable AI features backed by a solid infrastructure spine. v2.1 defined the agentic backend contract (LangGraph agents, SSE streaming, FE tool interrupts, two-level autonomy). What remains unaddressed is **the experience layer** — the gap between "AI features that work" and "AI features that users trust, understand, and adopt."

An independent audit found **94 component-level UX gaps** and **25 product-level issues**. A parallel review of 2025–2026 AI product design literature surfaced 20 actionable rules and 60+ source references.

v3 is a **UX-focused PRD**. It does not replace v2.1's backend architecture; it builds the product surface on top of it. The core thesis:

> AI features fail not because the model is wrong, but because the interface doesn't help users calibrate trust, recover from errors, or understand what happened.

Engineers and designers should treat v2.1 as the _what_ (capabilities, transport, data contracts) and this document as the _how_ (interaction patterns, copy, states, accessibility, error handling).

### Seven Design Moves

1. **Stream everything visible.** Show the first token in ≤700ms. Never replace a spinner with a final result in a single paint.
2. **Confidence UI everywhere.** Replace raw percentages with calibrated confidence bands, reasons, and escape hatches.
3. **Citations as first-class UI.** Every AI answer that references project data shows verifiable, clickable, source-linked citations.
4. **Progressive onboarding, not feature dumps.** New users see three deterministic prompts, not a blank chat. Features reveal themselves through use.
5. **Unified AI surface architecture.** One right-rail panel with tabs (Chat, Brief, Inbox, History) replaces four separate drawers. Command palette is the keyboard-first entry point.
6. **Mutation previews with tracked changes.** Every AI-proposed change shows a visual diff before execution, with inline Accept/Reject per field. Every mutation has a 10-second toast Undo.
7. **Privacy surfaces are non-negotiable.** "What is shared?" disclosure before the first message. One tap away from any AI panel.

## 2. Governing Principles

These seven principles govern every decision in this document. When a spec detail is ambiguous, pick the reading that best satisfies the most applicable principle.

### P1 — Stream Everything Visible

Show the first token in ≤700ms of agent response latency. Never replace a loading spinner with a final result in a single paint; always stream intermediate content. A placeholder skeleton that dissolves into streamed text is acceptable; a blank → full-text swap is not.

_Source: Nielsen Norman Group "AI UX" 2025; Anthropic "Claude streaming best practices"; Vercel AI SDK streaming guidelines._

### P2 — Never Abandon the User

Every AI surface must have at least three states beyond the happy path: a loading/streaming state, an error recovery state with a human-readable message, and an empty/no-result state with a next action. The empty state must never be a blank area.

_Source: "Designing AI Products" (Lenny's Newsletter 2025); Google PAIR Explorables._

### P3 — Trust Through Transparency

Confidence scores must appear as labeled bands (High / Moderate / Low) paired with a percentage. Citations must be inline chips with required `quote` fields. Every AI-generated field must carry a visual "Suggested by Copilot" badge until the user edits it. Rationale must be surfaced by default, not behind a toggle. When confidence is low, default to a safer behavior: show alternatives, ask for clarification, or decline to answer.

_Source: Perplexity citation pattern; Linear "Magic" UX review 2025; "Building trust in AI systems" — Microsoft Research; Confidence UI pattern (Modexa 2026)._

### P4 — Mutations Need a Safety Net

No AI action that writes data may execute without either: (a) an explicit user confirmation step that includes a preview diff, or (b) a 10-second toast Undo for low-risk, reversible changes. "Auto" autonomy (admin only) still requires Undo. The preview diff must show field names and old→new values; it must not be a JSON dump.

_Source: v2.1 §6 autonomy design; Superhuman "undo-for-everything" pattern; Notion AI mutation UX._

### P5 — Discoverability Over Assumption

Users cannot benefit from features they do not know exist. Each AI surface must expose at least three sample prompts or representative capabilities on first open. The global Copilot entry point must be reachable from every top-level view in ≤2 gestures. Features reveal themselves through use, not through tours or feature dumps.

_Source: Raycast AI discoverability research 2025; OpenAI "ChatGPT Explore" onboarding audit; Progressive disclosure (IxDF 2026)._

### P6 — Accessible by Default

All AI surfaces must meet WCAG 2.2 AA. Streaming content must use `aria-live="polite"` regions. Motion-heavy features must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. Copilot icon gradients must meet WCAG contrast in both themes.

_Source: WCAG 2.2 (W3C); A11y Project "Accessible AI Interfaces" 2025._

### P7 — Privacy Surfaces Are Non-Negotiable

The "What is shared with the agent?" disclosure must be present before the user sends the first message in any new thread. It must accurately describe every category of data sent. It must be one tap/click away from any AI panel.

## 4. Competitive Analysis

### 4.1 Linear

| Strength                                                      | Lesson for Board Copilot                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Keyboard-first (`Cmd+K` everything)**                       | Our command palette exists but AI mode is a placeholder. Ship it.                                                      |
| **AI Triage auto-routes incoming issues (85% accuracy)**      | Our triage-agent exists in spec but has no UI. Ship the Inbox.                                                         |
| **Sub-100ms response times, local-first architecture**        | Our local engine is synchronous and fast — leverage this as the instant-feedback layer while the remote agent streams. |
| **Minimal, scannable UI — dense rows, not card-heavy boards** | Our AI panels (especially the chat drawer) are text-heavy walls. Add structure: cards, dividers, collapsible sections. |
| **Dark theme by default, clean typography**                   | We have dark mode. Ensure all AI surfaces respect both themes via CSS custom properties.                               |

### 4.2 Atlassian Jira (Rovo / AI)

| Strength                                       | Lesson for Board Copilot                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agents as assignees — run inside workflows** | v3 is not there yet (requires real backend), but the mutation proposal pattern is the stepping stone. |
| **AI-powered issue creation + summaries**      | We have this. Invest in quality (citations, confidence) rather than breadth.                          |
| **Deep integration with Confluence/Bitbucket** | We don't have integrations. Focus on what we can do well: in-product AI with verifiable citations.    |

### 4.3 Notion AI

| Strength                                                                    | Lesson for Board Copilot                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AI content generation inline — write/rewrite/summarize where text lives** | Our "Rewrite with AI" button (v2.1 §7.3) is the right scope.                                                |
| **Beautiful, minimalist design**                                            | AI surfaces should inherit the design system, not fight it.                                                 |
| **Q&A across workspace**                                                    | Our semantic search + chat already do this. The gap is quality (embeddings vs. Jaccard) and UX (citations). |

### 4.4 Industry Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern                  | Risk in Board Copilot                                   | Mitigation                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Illusion of determinism**   | Estimation shows "5 points" as if it's the right answer | Confidence bands + "one possible estimate" language + show alternatives                 |
| **Black box AI**              | Chat answers without showing reasoning or sources       | Mandatory citations with required `quote` field; "Sources (N)" footnote                 |
| **Feature dump onboarding**   | Board header has 4+ AI controls visible simultaneously  | Progressive disclosure: consolidate into one Copilot entry; reveal features through use |
| **Overconfident personality** | Chat uses "I understand" or "I think"                   | Neutral, tool-like tone: "Based on 3 tasks in Backlog..."                               |
| **Hidden uncertainty**        | Local engine always produces an answer, never hedges    | Low-confidence threshold: if confidence < 0.45, show "Low confidence — verify manually" |
| **No failure UI**             | Errors show generic messages                            | Specific failure reasons + suggested next inputs                                        |
| **No undo**                   | "Apply suggestion" fills form fields with no revert     | Every Apply has a 10-second toast Undo + "Revert to previous"                           |

| S-04 | No `role="img"` when used as a meaningful icon                                                            | Medium   |
| S-05 | Gradient colors are not themeable via design tokens                                                       | Low      |

#### Requirements

**S-R1.** Replace the module-level `gradientId` counter with React `useId()`. Stable across SSR/hydration, unique per-instance.

**S-R2.** Two gradient presets via `variant` prop: `"default"` (light) and `"dark"`. Active preset selected from CSS custom properties so `prefers-color-scheme` overrides automatically.

**S-R3.** When `aria-hidden` is not passed, require `role="img"` and explicit `aria-label`. `AiSparkleIcon` without either `aria-hidden` or `aria-label` must produce a TypeScript type error.

**S-R4.** Add `size` prop: `"sm" | "md" | "lg"` mapping to `14 / 18 / 24` px. Migrate all consuming components to this prop.

### 6.2 Chat Drawer (`AiChatDrawer`)

#### Issues

| #    | Issue                                                                           | Severity |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| C-01 | `destroyOnHidden` wipes the entire transcript on close                          | Critical |
| C-02 | Tool call messages rendered as raw `<pre>` JSON                                 | High     |
| C-03 | No Stop button — only escape from runaway stream is closing the drawer          | High     |
| C-04 | No streaming — full response renders in one paint                               | High     |
| C-05 | Input not disabled during streaming — second message silently drops             | High     |
| C-06 | Sample prompts shown only on initial empty state; disappear after first message | Medium   |
| C-07 | Error messages appear as raw text with no retry affordance                      | Medium   |
| C-08 | Citations not rendered — `useAiChat` does not surface `CitationRef[]`           | High     |

| C-12 | Thumbs feedback buttons always `disabled={isLoading}` — never re-enable         | Medium   |
| C-13 | Drawer title is static "Board Copilot" — no thread context                      | Low      |

#### Architecture Change

Migrate from `useAiChat` to `useAgent("chat-agent")`. This unlocks real streaming, citations, nudges, proposal cards, and FE tool interrupts. `useAiChat` becomes fallback-only.

#### Requirements

**C-R1. Persistent transcript.** Remove `destroyOnHidden`. Transcript persists for the lifetime of the parent route. Add "New conversation" button for voluntary reset.

**C-R2. Streaming text.** Use `useAgent`'s message stream. Each assistant turn streams character by character. `aria-live="polite"` region wrapping assistant bubbles. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`: render full batch without per-character animation when enabled.

**C-R3. Stop button.** Render `<Button icon={<StopOutlined />}>Stop</Button>` when `isStreaming`. Calls `agent.abort()`. 44×44 px touch target.

**C-R4. Input guard.** Disable text input and send button while `isStreaming`. Show spinner inside send button.

**C-R5. Sample prompts.** Three contextual chips on every empty turn (after each complete response, not just first open). Cache-driven:

1. "What's at risk on this board?"
2. "{lastTouchedTaskName} — what's the status?" (contextual, from cache)
3. "Who has the most open work?"

Clicking populates input; user still presses Send.

**C-R6. Error state.** Inline alert: "Board Copilot hit an error. [Try again]". "Try again" resubmits last user message. Never show raw `error.message`.

**C-R7. Citation chips.** Render citations as `[1]`-style superscript chips at end of assistant bubble. Click opens popover: entity name, type, verbatim quote excerpt, navigate link (tasks/projects) or tooltip (members). `role="link"` with keyboard focus. Clicking a navigate link scrolls the source entity into view with a 1-second pulse-highlight border.

**C-R8. Nudge cards.** Render each `TriageNudge` as a compact card below the assistant bubble: severity icon, title, primary CTA button, dismiss link. Fires `ANALYTICS_EVENTS.NUDGE_DISMISSED` on dismiss.

**C-R9. Proposal preview card.** When `pendingProposal` is non-null, render `MutationProposalCard` between last bubble and input:

- Title: "Copilot wants to [verb] [entity name]"
- Diff table: Field | Current | Proposed (red/green text)
- Risk band chip (Low/Medium/High)
- "Undoable" badge
- Accept button → `agent.resume({ accepted: true })`
- Reject button → `agent.resume({ accepted: false })`
- Input locked while proposal pending

**C-R10. Privacy link.** `"What is shared?" ⓘ` link in drawer header. Opens `CopilotPrivacyPopover` listing: board name, column list, task names and status, member names, current user ID. No task notes or emails shared unless user pastes them.

**C-R11. Tool call display.** Replace raw `<pre>` with collapsed `<details>`: tool name as `<summary>`, human-readable summary inside ("Copilot looked up [N] tasks matching '[query]'"). Default: collapsed. Keyboard accessible.

**C-R12. Thumbs feedback.** Enable after stream ends (`!isStreaming`). On click: fire analytics, show "Thanks for your feedback" toast. Filled icon shows recorded choice. Optional "What went wrong?" textarea on thumbs-down (progressive disclosure).

**C-R13. Code block containment.** `overflow-x: auto; max-width: 100%`. Monospace 13px with `word-break: break-all` fallback.

**C-R14. Regenerate button.** Circular arrow icon below each assistant message. Re-runs same prompt with `regenerate: true`.

**C-R15. Character counter.** Show `{current}/{max}` when user types > 500 chars. Max = 2000.

**C-R16. Session persistence (opt-in).** Toggle in Settings. Conversations persist via LangGraph checkpointer. Session list appears as sidebar within Chat tab.

**C-R17. Save to task note.** Button on each assistant turn. Writes answer (with citations) to focused task's note, behind confirmation. Appends with horizontal rule separator; never replaces without confirmation.

**Microcopy guidelines:**

- Never "I think" / "I understand." Use "Based on..." or "Looking at..."
- Error: "I couldn't find an answer. Try rephrasing, or check [Sources] for what I looked at."
- Rate limit: "Board Copilot is at capacity. Please try again in {retryAfter} seconds."
- Project disabled: "Board Copilot is turned off for this project. An admin can enable it in Settings."

### 6.3 Task Assist Panel (`AiTaskAssistPanel`)

#### Issues

| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| T-01  | Story-points Apply button executes with no undo affordance                     | High     |
| T-02  | Confidence shown as raw `%` only — no band label                               | Medium   |
| T-03  | `confidenceBand` implemented but never shown in the label                      | Medium   |
| T-04  | No visual distinction between AI-suggested and user-entered values             | High     |
| T-05  | Similar-task list shows task ID as fallback when name is undefined             | Medium   |
| T-06  | Readiness issues have no "Dismiss" affordance                                  | Medium   |
| T-07  | No explanation when AI can't estimate — spinner disappears leaving blank space | High     |
| T-08  | Re-runs on every debounced change including whitespace-only                    | Medium   |
| T-09  | Panel is always expanded — no collapse affordance                              | Low      |
| T-09b | Apply suggestion for readiness fires with no preview                           | High     |
| T-10  | No "Regenerate" affordance                                                     | Medium   |
| T-11  | Stale data from previous task shown when name is blank                         | High     |
| T-12  | No "Board Copilot" branding consistency with other surfaces                    | Low      |
| T-13  | No ARIA live region                                                            | Medium   |

#### Requirements

**T-R1. Undo for story points.** Two-step flow: button changes to "Applied ✓" for 10 seconds, toast appears "Story points set to [N]. [Undo]". Undo restores previous value. After 10 seconds, Undo expires.

**T-R2. Confidence band display.** Compound display: `[Band Tag] (percentage%)`. Tag colors: High → green, Moderate → orange, Low → red. Tooltip: "Based on [N] similar tasks on this board." At Low confidence, Apply button becomes "Apply anyway" (secondary style).

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Suggested: 5 points                 │
│  [High] (87%)                        │
│  "3 similar tasks averaged 5 pts"    │
│  [Why?] [Apply] [Show alternatives]  │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**T-R3. AI-suggested field badge.** On Apply, target field receives `data-ai-suggested` and renders a small purple "Suggested by Copilot" label beneath it until user manually edits. Clicking badge opens popover: "This value was suggested by Board Copilot based on [N] similar tasks. [View reasoning] [Revert to previous]"

**T-R4. Undo for readiness suggestions.** Same 10-second toast+Undo pattern as T-R1.

**T-R5. Dismiss readiness issue.** Each readiness Alert has `closable` prop. Dismissing hides for current session; reappears on reopen.

**T-R6. Empty/loading state copy.** While no estimate and no error and user hasn't typed: "Type a task name above to get an estimate."

**T-R7. Stale-data guard.** When task name is cleared, immediately reset both `estimateAi` and `readinessAi`.

**T-R8. Regenerate button.** `↺ Regenerate` icon button next to heading. Re-fires estimate bypassing debounce. Disabled while loading.

**T-R9. Whitespace-change guard.** Compare `taskName.trim()` to previous trimmed value. Skip API call if only whitespace changed.

**T-R10. ARIA live region.** Wrap estimate output in `<div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="false">`.

**T-R11. "Why?" expandable rationale.** "Why this number?" link opens popover with citations (similar tasks, deep-linked) and agent rationale.

**T-R12. Show alternatives.** "Show alternatives" button displays the runner-up estimate with its confidence band.

### 6.4 Task Draft Modal (`AiTaskDraftModal`)

#### Issues

| #    | Issue                                                            | Severity |

| D-02 | No "Suggested by Copilot" badges on auto-populated fields        | High     |
| D-03 | No breakdown axis picker (v2.1 specifies 4 axes)                 | High     |
| D-04 | Sequential `createTask` loop has no progress indicator           | High     |
| D-05 | Confidence shown as raw `%`                                      | Medium   |
| D-06 | No "Regenerate draft" affordance                                 | Medium   |
| D-07 | No undo when subtasks are created in bulk                        | High     |
| D-08 | Task type icon defaults to generic circle for unrecognized types | Low      |
| D-09 | Modal does not clear draft state when closed and reopened        | High     |
| D-10 | No privacy disclosure (first use)                                | High     |
| D-11 | "Create [N] subtasks" label doesn't update with count changes    | Medium   |
| D-12 | Breakdown list shows names only — no column/assignee preview     | Medium   |
| D-13 | Long descriptions overflow on small screens                      | Medium   |
| D-14 | No Cmd+Enter keyboard shortcut                                   | Low      |
| D-15 | No analytics for breakdown axis selection                        | Low      |

#### Requirements

**D-R1. Sample prompts on open.** Three chips when prompt is empty:

- "Draft a bug fix task for [board name]"
- "Plan a feature for [first epic name or 'this project']"
- "Create a research spike"

Use `microcopy.ai.draftSuggestions` for translatability.

**D-R2. AI field badges.** After draft populates form, every AI-filled field renders `<Tag color="purple" size="small">AI</Tag>` beneath label. Badge clears on manual edit.

**D-R3. Breakdown axis picker.** `<Select>` above breakdown list:

| Value        | Label              | Tooltip                          |
| ------------ | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `by_phase`   | By phase           | "Frontend, backend, testing"     |
| `by_surface` | By surface         | "UI, API, data, infra"           |
| `by_risk`    | By risk            | "High risk first, low risk last" |
| `freeform`   | Let Copilot decide | "Agent picks the best split"     |

Default: `freeform`. Change re-runs breakdown (500ms debounce). Fires `ANALYTICS_EVENTS.BREAKDOWN_AXIS_CHANGED`.

**D-R4. Bulk-create progress.** `<Progress percent={...} status="active" />`: "Creating subtask [N] of [total]…". On partial failure: pause, show "Skip and continue" / "Retry".

**D-R5. Undo bulk create.** Toast: "[N] subtasks created. [Undo]". Undo deletes each created task. 10-second window.

**D-R6. Regenerate.** `↺ Regenerate draft` button, re-runs with same prompt. Disabled while loading.

**D-R7. Modal state reset.** On close, reset AI hook and clear form back to defaults.

**D-R8. Privacy disclosure (first use).** First submit checks `localStorage.getItem("boardCopilot:draftPrivacyShown")`. If not shown:

> "Copilot will see your board's task list, column names, and member names. No task notes or emails are sent."
> [Got it] [Don't remind me]

**D-R9. Cmd+Enter submit.** `Cmd+Enter` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Enter` (other) triggers submit. Hint beneath input: "Cmd+Enter to draft".

**D-R10. Breakdown preview columns.** Each subtask row shows: task name (bold), proposed column (secondary), assigned member avatar.

### 6.5 Board Brief Drawer (`BoardBriefDrawer`)

#### Issues

| #    | Issue                                                          | Severity |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| B-01 | Auto-fires AI on every open — no caching                       | High     |
| B-02 | No "Copy as Markdown" action                                   | High     |
| B-03 | No "Save as task note" action                                  | Medium   |
| B-04 | No refresh button                                              | Medium   |
| B-05 | `openTaskFromBrief` closes drawer — loses board context        | High     |
| B-06 | Recommendations render as plain text — no CTA                  | High     |
| B-07 | Re-runs when drawer reopens even if data unchanged             | High     |
| B-08 | No streaming                                                   | High     |
| B-09 | No error retry affordance                                      | Medium   |
| B-10 | Risk section shows raw counts with no links to see which tasks | Medium   |
| B-11 | No "Generated X minutes ago" timestamp                         | Low      |
| B-12 | Data destroyed when drawer closes (`destroyOnHidden`)          | Medium   |
| B-13 | No progress indicator during generation                        | High     |
| B-14 | Footer buttons have no `aria-label`                            | Low      |

#### Requirements

**B-R1. Smart caching.** Don't re-run if: cached brief < 5 minutes old AND board data unchanged. Show cached brief with "Generated [N] minutes ago". Auto-refresh on stale.

**B-R2. Streaming brief.** Migrate to `useAgent("board-brief-agent")`. Progressive rendering with `aria-live="polite"`. Shimmer skeleton for first 300ms, dissolves as tokens arrive.

**B-R3. "What changed" headline.** Headline computed from what changed since user's last brief read (stored as `last_brief_read_at` in `BaseStore`). Priority: load imbalance > WIP overflow > unowned bug in 24h > backlog dilution > "Board looks balanced."

**B-R4. Visual workload bars.** Horizontal bar segments per member, open points relative to team average. Overloaded members in warning color.

**B-R5. Copy as Markdown.** Footer button. `navigator.clipboard.writeText(briefMarkdown)`. Success: `message.success("Copied to clipboard")`.

**B-R6. Save as task note.** Footer button. Opens task-create modal with brief as note, name "Board brief — [date]". Brief drawer stays open.

**B-R7. Refresh button.** Footer button. Bypasses cache, re-runs brief. Disabled while streaming. Fires `ANALYTICS_EVENTS.BRIEF_REFRESHED`.

**B-R8. Keep drawer open on task open.** Never close brief as side effect of clicking a task link. Open task in secondary view or new tab.

**B-R9. Recommendation CTAs.** Each recommendation includes a CTA:

| Type          | CTA           | Action                     |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| `reassign`    | "Reassign…"   | Opens assignee picker      |
| `move_column` | "Move…"       | Opens column picker        |
| `add_subtask` | "Break down…" | Opens breakdown pre-filled |
| `create_task` | "Create task" | Opens draft modal          |
| Other         | "Open task"   | Navigates to task          |

**B-R10. Risk section links.** Each count (e.g., "3 blocked tasks") is a clickable link opening a filtered board view.

**B-R11. Generated timestamp.** "Generated [relative time] ago" at bottom. Updates on refresh.

**B-R12. Error retry.** `Alert type="error" message="Couldn't generate brief." action={<Button size="small">Try again</Button>}`.

**B-R13. Persist across close.** Remove `destroyOnHidden`. Maintain content and scroll position.

**B-R14. Citations.** Each task/member reference is a clickable chip that deep-links to the entity.

### 6.6 Semantic Search Input (`AiSearchInput`)

#### Issues

| #     | Issue                                                        | Severity |

| SR-03 | Input disabled during search — can't type next query         | High     |
| SR-04 | No result count for screen readers                           | Medium   |
| SR-05 | No streaming for results                                     | Medium   |
| SR-06 | No "Why this result?" tooltip                                | Low      |
| SR-07 | Search icon button has no `aria-label`                       | High     |
| SR-08 | No keyboard shortcut to focus search                         | Low      |
| SR-09 | Error state shows raw string with no retry                   | Medium   |
| SR-10 | No distinction between "no AI results" and "no tasks at all" | High     |

#### Requirements

**SR-R1. Inline clear.** Use Ant Design `Input` `allowClear` prop.

**SR-R2. Result rationale.** Beneath each result: `"Matched because: [reason]"` in secondary text. Collapsed by default; expand on hover.

**SR-R3. Non-blocking input.** Don't disable during search. Show spinner suffix. New query cancels previous (abort controller).

**SR-R4. Screen reader announcement.** `aria-live="assertive"` region: "Found [N] tasks matching '[query]'" or "No tasks matched '[query]'".

**SR-R5. "Why this result?" tooltip.** `<InfoCircleOutlined />` per result with full rationale on hover/focus.

**SR-R6. Search button aria-label.** `aria-label="Search with AI"`.

**SR-R7. Empty state disambiguation.** Board has tasks: "No tasks matched your search. Try different words, or [clear] to see all tasks." No tasks: "This board has no tasks yet."

**SR-R8. Error retry.** "Search failed. [Try again]" link resubmits last query.

**SR-R9. "Did you mean…?" reformulations.** When local search returns 0 hits, show up to 3 AI-generated reformulations the user can click.

### 6.7 Command Palette (`CommandPalette`)

#### Issues

| #     | Issue                                                                      | Severity |

| CP-12 | No empty-state illustration                                                | Low      |
| CP-13 | No result count announced to screen readers                                | Medium   |
| CP-14 | `isMacLike()` uses deprecated `navigator.platform`                         | Low      |
| CP-15 | No loading state while list populates                                      | Medium   |
| CP-16 | Query not trimmed — leading spaces cause false no-matches                  | Low      |
| CP-17 | "Phase E" internal naming in user-visible copy                             | High     |

#### Requirements

**CP-R1. Fix Tab behavior.** Remove Tab as AI toggle. AI mode via: (a) "/" as first character, (b) dedicated sparkle toggle button with `aria-label`.

**CP-R2. "/" mode sync.** Immediate effect: query starts with "/" → AI mode on; doesn't → off.

**CP-R3. Fix `aria-expanded`.** `aria-expanded={visible.length > 0}`. In AI mode: `false`.

**CP-R4. Fuzzy ranking.** Combined score: prefix match (0), substring (idx+1), token match (50+idx). Tiebreak by entity type priority (project > task > column > member), then recency (-10 for last 24h). Group headers when results span kinds.

**CP-R5. Mobile bottom sheet.** On `!screens.md`: Ant Design Drawer, `placement="bottom"`, 50vh. Full-width search + results. AI mode works on mobile.

**CP-R6. Wire AI mode.** Enter in AI mode → dismiss palette → open Copilot right-rail Chat tab → pre-populate and start.

**CP-R7. "/" detection fix.** Only index 0 triggers AI mode.

**CP-R8. Fix ARIA tree.** `role="listbox"` on `<ListContainer>`. Each `<Row>` has `role="option"`. Separator rows use `role="presentation"`.

**CP-R9. Result count announcement.** `aria-live="polite"` region, 300ms debounced: "[N] results" or "No results".

**CP-R10. Fix `navigator.platform`.** Use `navigator.userAgentData?.platform` with fallback.

**CP-R11. Trim query.** Apply `.trim()` before filtering.

**CP-R12. Remove internal phase names.** No "Phase E" in user-visible copy. Use "AI mode" or "Ask Copilot".

## 7. Unified AI Surface Architecture

### 7.1 Right-Rail Panel

**Problem:** Four separate surfaces compete for the right edge of the screen.

**Solution:** Single right-rail panel with tabbed navigation:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Board Copilot                   [×] │
│  ┌──────┬──────┬───────┬─────────┐  │
│  │ Chat │ Brief│ Inbox │ History │  │
│  └──────┴──────┴───────┴─────────┘  │
│                                      │
│  [Tab-specific content]              │
│                                      │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Width:** 420px on desktop (`lg+`); collapses to icon bar at `md`; full-width bottom sheet on mobile (`xs`/`sm`).
- **Tabs:** Chat (default), Brief, Inbox (unread badge), History.
- **Persistence:** Open/closed + active tab in `localStorage`.
- **Keyboard:** `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+C` toggle. `Cmd/Ctrl+K` + `/` → AI mode opens Chat.
- **ARIA:** `role="tablist"` for tabs; `role="tabpanel"` with `aria-labelledby` per panel.
- **Motion:** 300ms ease-in-out slide; `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` → instant.

### 7.2 Inbox Tab — Triage Nudges

Per v2.1 §7.8:

- **Nudge cards:** Icon (severity), one-sentence description, relative timestamp, action button, dismiss (×).
- **Aggregation:** Max 5 active per board. Same-type nudges replace older ones.
- **Decay:** Auto-dismiss on state change. Expire after 4 hours. Dismissed immediately on user action.
- **Empty state:** "No nudges right now. Board Copilot checks for issues every 15 minutes."
- **Badge:** Header icon, unread count capped at 9+.

### 7.3 History Tab — Action History

Per v2.1 §6.2:

- **Entry:** Timestamp, action description, status badge (Applied / Undone / Rejected / Expired), expand arrow for details.
- **Toast Undo:** After any accepted mutation: top-right toast with 10-second countdown. Click → inverse mutation → "Undone" confirmation.
- **Filtering:** By date, action type, status.
- **Empty state:** "No AI actions yet. Changes made with Board Copilot will appear here."

### 7.4 Mutation Preview

When the agent proposes a mutation:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Proposed: Reassign 2 tasks          │
│                                      │
│  1. "Fix login bug"                  │
│     Coordinator: Maya → Priya        │
│  2. "Update token refresh"           │
│     Coordinator: Maya → Priya        │
│                                      │
│  [Accept All] [Review Each] [Reject] │
│  Risk: Medium · Undoable             │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- `role="alertdialog"` — focus trapped. `Enter` accepts, `Escape` rejects.
- "Edit" opens inline fields for tweaking before accept.
- "Review Each" shows one-at-a-time cards for bulk proposals.
- Risk band as colored chip. "Undoable" badge.
- After acceptance: 10-second toast + History entry.

### 7.5 "Rewrite with AI" — Task Note Editor

Button above textarea: "✨ Rewrite with AI". Opens side panel (not modal — textarea stays visible):

- Rewrite as user story
- Add acceptance criteria
- Translate to {user locale}
- Summarize in 2 lines
- Polish tone
- Free prompt

Flow: select option → streaming rewrite in side panel → diff view for notes >3 lines, plain text for shorter → Accept replaces + badge → Cancel dismisses. Keyboard: Tab through options, Enter select, Escape cancel.

## 8. Onboarding & Progressive Disclosure

### 8.1 First-Time Experience

When user first encounters Board Copilot (first `boardCopilot:enabled` on a project with tasks):

**Welcome banner** (top of board, dismissible):

> ✨ Board Copilot is ready
> I can help you draft tasks, estimate work, summarize this board, and answer questions.
> [Try it: "Summarize this board"] [Dismiss]

- Appears once, stored as `boardCopilot:onboarded`.
- CTA opens Chat tab and runs a brief.
- Dismissing hides forever.

**Contextual tooltips** (once per feature on first encounter):

- First Draft: "Type a description and Board Copilot will fill in the details."
- First Assist panel: "Board Copilot suggests story points based on similar tasks."
- First Brief: "This summary updates every time you open it."
- Each has "Got it" to dismiss and "Don't show tips" to suppress all.

### 8.2 Progressive Feature Revelation

Features surface based on usage maturity:

| User Action                | Feature Revealed                                    |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Creates first task with AI | "Tip: You can also break tasks into subtasks"       |
| Opens 3rd task modal       | "Board Copilot can suggest story points" tooltip    |
| Runs 2nd brief             | "Copy as Markdown to share this summary" hint       |
| Sends 5th chat message     | "Use / in the command palette for quick AI actions" |
| Has 10+ tasks              | Triage Inbox becomes visible in tabs                |

Each revelation is a single non-blocking tooltip. Never a modal. Never blocking work.

### 8.3 Cold-Start States

| Surface         | Cold-Start                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chat            | Three onboarding prompts: "What can Board Copilot do?", "Summarize this board", "Draft a sample task" |
| Brief           | Structural counts + "Not enough history for trends. Brief gets smarter as the board grows."           |
| Estimation      | Local heuristic + "Estimate based on board averages — accuracy improves with more tasks."             |
| Inbox           | "No nudges yet. Board Copilot checks every 15 minutes."                                               |
| History         | "No AI actions yet. Changes made with Board Copilot will appear here."                                |
| Palette AI mode | "What Copilot can do" help panel                                                                      |

## 9. Cross-Cutting Requirements

### 9.1 Streaming & Latency

**X-R1.** All network AI calls must go through `useAgent` or maintain `AbortController` support. No bare `fetch` without a bound signal.

**X-R2.** Every streaming surface must provide a Stop action, keyboard-reachable.

**X-R3.** TTFT target: 700ms. Measure via `performance.mark()`. Fire `ANALYTICS_EVENTS.AGENT_TTFT`.

**X-R4.** Network timeout watchdog: 30 seconds with no stream tokens → `abort()` + timeout error.

### 9.2 Error Handling

**X-R5.** All AI error states follow this template:

- **Heading:** Plain-language description ("Couldn't generate board brief")
- **Body:** (Optional) one sentence of context
- **Primary action:** "Try again" — retries last operation
- **Secondary:** (Optional) "Dismiss"
- Never show raw `error.message` or HTTP status codes

### 9.3 Confidence Display

**X-R6.** Everywhere confidence is displayed, use compound format: `[Band Tag] (percentage%)`. Extract `confidenceBand()` to `src/utils/ai/confidenceBand.ts` — shared across all surfaces.

### 9.4 Accessibility

**X-R7.** Streaming regions: `aria-live="polite"` unless time-critical (error blocking action → `"assertive"`).

**X-R8.** Icon accessibility: decorative → `aria-hidden`. Meaningful → explicit `aria-label`. TypeScript enforced.

**X-R9.** Focus indicators: 2px outline in `var(--ant-color-primary)` on all AI interactive elements. WCAG 2.2 Focus Appearance.

**X-R10.** `prefers-reduced-motion` checks on: shimmer animations (`animation: none`), token streaming (render full batch), toast transitions (instant).

### 9.5 Design Tokens

**X-R11.** New `src/theme/aiTokens.ts`:

```ts
export const ai = {
    gradStart: "var(--color-copilot-grad-start)",
    gradEnd: "var(--color-copilot-grad-end)",
    bgSubtle: "var(--color-copilot-bg-subtle)",
    bgMedium: "var(--color-copilot-bg-medium)",
    badgePurple: "#7C5CFF"
};
```

**X-R12.** CSS custom properties in `:root` and `:root[data-theme="dark"]`:

```css
:root {
    --color-copilot-grad-start: #7c5cff;
    --color-copilot-grad-end: #c084fc;
    --color-copilot-bg-subtle: rgba(124, 92, 255, 0.06);
    --color-copilot-bg-medium: rgba(124, 92, 255, 0.15);
}
:root[data-theme="dark"] {
    --color-copilot-grad-start: #a78bfa;
    --color-copilot-grad-end: #e879f9;
    --color-copilot-bg-subtle: rgba(167, 139, 250, 0.08);
    --color-copilot-bg-medium: rgba(167, 139, 250, 0.18);
}
```

### 9.6 Microcopy

**X-R13.** Add to `src/constants/microcopy.ts`:

```ts
ai: {
    draftSuggestions: ["Draft a bug fix task", "Plan a new feature", "Create a research spike"],
    privacyDisclosure: "Copilot sees your board's task names, columns, and member names. No notes or emails are shared.",
    privacyLink: "What is shared?",
    streaming: "Board Copilot is thinking…",
    stopped: "Stopped.",
    retryLabel: "Try again",
    regenerateLabel: "Regenerate",
    undoLabel: "Undo",
    copiedConfirm: "Copied to clipboard",
    feedbackThanks: "Thanks for your feedback",
    confidenceBands: { high: "High", moderate: "Moderate", low: "Low" },
},
```

### 9.7 Privacy

**X-R14.** New `CopilotPrivacyPopover` component at `src/components/copilotPrivacyPopover/index.tsx`. Popover with:

- Title: "What Board Copilot sees"
- Bulleted list: board name, column names, task names, member names, current user ID
- Fine print: "No task notes, member emails, or attachments are ever sent."
- Used by: AiChatDrawer (C-R10), AiTaskDraftModal (D-R8), exportable for reuse.

### 9.8 Analytics

**X-R15.** Add to `ANALYTICS_EVENTS`:

```ts
AGENT_TTFT: "agent_ttft",
BRIEF_REFRESHED: "brief_refreshed",
BREAKDOWN_AXIS_CHANGED: "breakdown_axis_changed",
PROPOSAL_ACCEPTED: "proposal_accepted",
PROPOSAL_REJECTED: "proposal_rejected",
CITATION_CLICKED: "citation_clicked",
NUDGE_DISMISSED: "nudge_dismissed",
SEARCH_RESULT_RATIONALE_VIEWED: "search_result_rationale_viewed",
UNDO_APPLIED: "undo_applied",
THUMBS_FEEDBACK: "thumbs_feedback",
COPILOT_CHAT_SEND: "copilot_chat_send",
COPILOT_CHAT_REGENERATE: "copilot_chat_regenerate",
COPILOT_ESTIMATE_APPLY: "copilot_estimate_apply",
COPILOT_BRIEF_OPEN: "copilot_brief_open",
COPILOT_DRAFT_SUBMIT: "copilot_draft_submit",
COPILOT_PALETTE_INVOKE: "copilot_palette_invoke",
COPILOT_REWRITE_ACCEPT: "copilot_rewrite_accept",
COPILOT_ONBOARDING_CTA: "copilot_onboarding_cta",
```

## 10. New Shared Components

### 10.1 `MutationProposalCard`

**Path:** `src/components/mutationProposalCard/index.tsx`

Props: `{ proposal, onAccept, onReject, isLoading? }`. Renders: header ("Copilot wants to [verb] [entity]"), diff table (Field | Current | Proposed with red/green), risk chip, undoable badge, Accept/Reject buttons.

### 10.2 `CitationChip`

**Path:** `src/components/citationChip/index.tsx`

Props: `{ index, citation, onNavigate? }`. Renders `<sup>` Tag with `role="link"`, `tabIndex={0}`. Click/Enter navigates; Tooltip shows `citation.title`, `citation.type`, verbatim `quote`.

### 10.3 `NudgeCard`

**Path:** `src/components/nudgeCard/index.tsx`

Props: `{ nudge, onAction, onDismiss }`. Compact Card with severity icon, title, action button, dismiss link.

### 10.4 `CopilotPrivacyPopover`

Spec in §9.7.

---

## 11. `useAgent` Hook Improvements

**UA-R1. Timeout watchdog.** 30-second watchdog in `consumeStream`. No new `StreamPart` in 30s → `abort()` + error: "Board Copilot took too long. Try again."

**UA-R2. TTFT measurement.** After first `StreamPart` of type `"messages"`: compute `performance.now() - streamStartTime`, fire `AGENT_TTFT`.

**UA-R3. `pendingProposal` auto-clear.** When stream ends with pending proposal, leave visible until user decides. Document explicitly.

**UA-R4. Expose `threadId`.** Add `threadId: string` to `UseAgentResult` for future share/export.

## 14. Acceptance Criteria

A feature is complete when:

1. **Functional:** Behaves per spec for happy path, all error states, and all empty states.
2. **Accessible:** Passes `axe-core` with zero critical/serious violations. Keyboard navigation confirmed.
3. **Responsive:** Renders at 375px / 768px / 1280px. No horizontal overflow. No meaning-losing truncation.
4. **Tested:** Unit tests for utilities. Integration tests for happy path + primary error. No test without new coverage.
5. **Analytics:** Fires correct `ANALYTICS_EVENTS` for every tracked action.
6. **Performance:** No CLS regression. No first-paint regression >50ms. TTFT <700ms p50.
7. **No regressions:** Existing test suite passes (5 pre-existing failures excluded from gate).

## 16. Red Flags Checklist

Use during design review of any AI surface. If any item is checked, the surface needs redesign.

- [ ] Presents AI output as factual without confidence indicator
- [ ] Shows raw confidence percentage without plain-language band
- [ ] Makes AI changes without user consent
- [ ] Hides what data was used — no citations, no "What is shared?"
- [ ] Uses anthropomorphic language ("I think", "I understand")
- [ ] Dumps all features at once — no progressive disclosure
- [ ] Shows blank/empty state with no guidance
- [ ] Exposes tool/function names to end users
- [ ] Has no feedback mechanism
- [ ] Has no undo
- [ ] Fails silently — generic error with no next step
- [ ] Blocks the primary flow on AI error
- [ ] Has no loading skeleton
- [ ] Lacks keyboard accessibility
- [ ] Missing `aria-live` on dynamic content
- [ ] Same surface on mobile — no adaptation
